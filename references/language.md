# ducktape — language reference (as implemented)

Every example below compiles today; most are lifted from `tests/`. The grammar
in EBNF form is `references/grammar.ebnf`. Anything not listed here is either
in the "Not yet implemented" table at the bottom or does not exist.

Comments run from `#` to end of line. The test harness assigns meaning to two
prefixes: `#! expect:` (first line of a `tests/fail` file) and `#>` (expected
stdout in `tests/run` files) — the language itself treats them as comments.

## Declarations

```
use std::io::print;                  # `std::` is the builtin namespace
use geometry::Point;                 # loads geometry.dt — see "Modules"

fun add(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int {     # return type via ->, omitted = ()
    a + b                            # last expression is the return value
}

pub struct Point<T> { x: T, y: T, }  # named struct; pub = visible to importers
struct Pair(Int, Int)                # tuple struct
struct Unit;                         # unit struct

enum Result<T, E> { Ok(T), Err(E), }

trait Drawable {                     # item signatures are resolved & checked
    type Color;                      # against impls (conformance)
    fun draw(self) -> Self.Color;    # `Self.Color` = abstract projection
    fun visible(self) -> Bool { return true; }  # default; impls may omit it
}

impl Drawable for Point<Int> { ... } # trait impl
impl<T> Box<T> { ... }               # generic inherent impl
impl Point<Int> {
    type Color = String;             # associated type
    fun new(x: Int, y: Int) -> Self { Point { x: x, y: y } }
}
```

`var` at file scope parses but **aborts the compiler** (registration has no
case for it) — declare variables inside functions only.

## Types

| Syntax | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Int` `Float` `Bool` `String` | primitives |
| `()` | unit |
| `(A, B)` | tuple |
| `[T]` | array of `T` |
| `fun(A, B) -> R` | function type |
| `Point<Int>` | generic instance |
| `Self`, `Self.Color`, `Point.Color` | self type, associated types |

## Statements and blocks

```
var x = 1;                    # inferred; no `let`, no `mut` — all vars mutable
var y: [Int] = [1, 2, 3];     # annotated
var (a, b) = (1, 2.5);        # destructuring — the binding is a pattern
var Point { x: px, y } = p;   # ... any irrefutable one, nested freely
x = 2;  x += 1;               # assignment / compound assignment (+= -= *= /=)
return expr;  return;         # bare return means ()
break;  continue;             # inside loops only
```

Blocks are expressions: the trailing expression without `;` is the block's
value; otherwise the block is `()`. A trailing block-form `if`/`match` counts
as the tail (`fun abs(n: Int) -> Int { if n < 0 { -n } else { n } }`). A block
ending in `return` has type `!` (never), which unifies with anything.

## Expressions

- Arithmetic `+ - * / %` on numerics; `Int op Float` widens to `Float`.
  `+` also concatenates `String`s.
- Comparison `< <= > >=` (numeric), `== !=` (same static type).
- Logic: keywords `and`, `or` (short-circuit), `not`. There is no `&&`/`||`.
- Unary minus `-x` (numeric).
- `if cond { .. } else { .. }` is an expression; without `else` it is `()`.
- `while cond { .. }` and `for x in iter { .. }` evaluate to `()`;
  `iter` may be an array or a range.
- Ranges: `a..b`, `a..=b` — Int-only, first-class values (`var r = 0..10;`).
- Casts: `x as T` — only `Int`↔`Float` and identity casts.
- String interpolation: `"x = {x}"` — segments must be Int/Float/Bool/String.
- Calls: `f(a, b)`; functions are first-class (`var g = f; g(1)`).
- Closures use pipes: `|x, y| => x + y`, `|n: Int| -> Int { return n * 2; }`.
  Unannotated params infer from a function-typed hint
  (`var f: fun(Int) -> Int = |x| => x + 1;`) or from use; a closure whose
  types can't be pinned down is an error. `break` cannot escape a closure.
- Paths: `Result::Ok(5)`, `Point::new(..)`. Explicit type arguments use
  turbofish in expression position: `Point::<Int>::new(1, 2)`. A bare
  `Point::new(..)` on a generic type selects the impl by method name and
  infers the type arguments from the call (first name match wins if several
  impls define the same name).
- Method calls: `p.draw()`, `p.x`, tuple access `t.0`. A method an impl
  omitted but whose trait gives a default body is inherited: the call checks
  against the trait's signature, projected into the impl's terms.
- Trait bounds on type parameters are written inline (`fun f<T: A + B>(..)`),
  in a `where` clause (`fun f<T>(..) -> R where T: B`), or both — they merge.
  A bound must name a trait. Bounds are *enforced*: instantiating a bounded
  parameter with a type that has no `impl Trait for T` is an error
  ("type 'Int' does not implement trait 'Named'"), reported at the call site
  once inference has solved the parameter — including for an explicitly
  written type argument (`need_a::<Q>(q)`). Inside the generic body the bound
  *is* what makes the trait's methods callable: `t.draw()` on a `T: Drawable`
  resolves against the bound's signature (first bound declaring the name
  wins), and `T.Color` names an associated type through it. Both are abstract
  until instantiation — the projection collapses to whatever the applicable
  impl bound it to once T is solved (`tests/pass/trait_bound_calls.dt`).
  A type parameter also *satisfies* the bounds it was declared with, so a
  bounded generic can hand its parameter to another one that requires the same
  trait (`tests/run/generic_impls.dt`).
- Generic code runs: each generic function, method and impl is compiled once
  per distinct tuple of type arguments, discovered from its call sites
  (`runtime.md` "Monomorphisation"). A generic definition nobody calls is
  never compiled and is not an error.

### match

```
var m = match p {
    Point { x: 10, y: val } if val > 0 => true,   # guard sees bindings
    _ => false,
};
```

Patterns: literals, `_`, bindings, tuples `(a, b)`, variants
`Result::Ok(v)` / `Status::Active`, structs `Point { x, y }` (including
literal sub-patterns `x: 10`). A tuple struct is written with its constructor
spelling, `Pair(a, b)`, in a pattern as in an expression.

The same patterns are the binding form of `var`, restricted to the
irrefutable ones — a `var` binding is a match with one arm and no guard, so
"irrefutable" is decided by the exhaustiveness checker below. `var Opt::Some(n)
= o;` is rejected (`refutable pattern in a 'var' binding`) because `Opt::None`
would reach no arm; use `match`.

Matches must be **exhaustive**; a gap is a compile error naming the missing
enum variant where it can (`match is not exhaustive: 'Shape::Point' is not
covered`). A guarded arm never counts towards coverage — whether it matches is
a runtime question. Types with no enumerable domain (`Int`, `Float`, `String`)
therefore always need a `_` or a binding arm.

### `?` propagation

`expr?` is structural: the operand must be an enum with exactly two
single-field tuple variants named `Ok` and `Err`, and the enclosing function
(or closure) must return the *same* enum; the `Err` payload types must unify.
The result is the `Ok` payload. There is no built-in `Result` — declare your
own (`tests/pass/propagate.dt`). This rule will move to a `Try` trait once
traits are fully checked.

## Modules

A program is one root `.dt` file plus every file reachable from it through
`use`. There is no `mod` keyword: `use` is what pulls a file in.

```
use geometry::Point;                 # <root_dir>/geometry.dt
use geo::point::{Point, Line};       # <root_dir>/geo/point.dt, two items
use util::Maybe as Opt;              # imported under a different name
```

The leading segments name the *file*; the final segment (or the brace group)
names the *items*. Paths are relative to the directory of the root file — the
one search root — for every module, including modules that are not the root.
A file reached by two different importers is loaded once.

Items are **private by default**; `pub` makes one importable:

```
pub struct Point { x: Int, y: Int }  # importable
fun helper() -> Int { 1 }            # private: `use m::helper;` is an error
```

Imports are **not** transitive. If `b.dt` does `use a::X;`, that does not
re-export `X` — `use b::X;` from a third module is an error. There is no
`pub use`.

A path is never module-qualified: once imported, an item is named directly
(`Point`, not `geometry::Point`). Trait `impl`s are the exception to all of
this — they are program-wide and apply wherever their type is used, whether or
not the defining module was imported.

A cycle in the import graph is an error, reported with the chain of modules
involved.

`std::` is a reserved namespace over the built-ins below; it never touches the
filesystem, so a local `std.dt` is unreachable. Its intermediate segments are
not modelled — `std::io::print` and `std::print` both name the same builtin.

## Built-ins

`print<T>(value)` — prints any value followed by a newline, returns `()`.
Registered in every module; the only builtin so far.

## Not yet implemented

| Gap | Behavior today |
|---|---|
| calling an inherited default method under `--run` | type-checks, but the VM has no chunk for it (the body would need monomorphising against the concrete self) — "calling an inherited default method is not supported by the VM yet" |
| extra (non-trait) methods in a trait impl | tolerated as inherent methods (Rust rejects them) |
| trait objects (`dyn Trait` values) | a trait names a type only in bound / `Self` position; there is no dynamic dispatch |
| `mod` declarations | no such keyword; `use` is what pulls a file in |
| `pub use` re-export | imports are not transitive; a third module can't reach through an importer |
| glob imports (`use a::*`) | not parsed; name each item |
| module-qualified paths (`geometry::Point`) | import the item and name it directly; the diagnostic says so |
| `pub` on impls, methods, and fields | parsed and ignored — a public type's fields and methods are all visible |
| visibility below module granularity (`pub(crate)` &c.) | `pub` is the only modifier |
| two spellings of one file (symlinks, unusual paths) | dedup is lexical, so the file would load twice and collide |
| top-level `var` (globals) | parses, then a registration diagnostic: move it into a function |
| tuple-struct struct-patterns `Pair { a, b }` | write the constructor spelling `Pair(a, b)` — "matching tuple struct with struct pattern syntax is not allowed" |
| variable shadowing diagnostics | a `var` may silently shadow an earlier one in the same scope (top-level *item* names do collide — that is an error) |
| overlapping method names across impls of one type | bare paths pick the first registered impl |
| capturing a `for` loop variable in a closure | runs, but the closure sees the loop variable's *final* value (one shared cell), not a per-iteration copy — `runtime.md` "Closures & upvalues" |
| infinitely deep generic instantiation | `fun grow<T>(v: T) { grow([v]) }` type-checks but names a new instantiation at every level; codegen stops at 32 and reports it (`runtime.md` "Monomorphisation") |
| more than 256 functions, counting one per instantiation | each instantiation takes a global slot, so a heavily generic program can outgrow the one-byte operand space |
| `print` named as a value (`var p = print;`) | a call lowers to `OP_PRINT`, so the builtin has no body to point a slot at — "using a builtin as a value is not supported by the VM yet" |
| generic `main` | nothing calls the entry point, so no instance is ever made — "'main' must not be generic" |
